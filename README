This digital artwork is inspired by Sol LeWitt’s wall drawings, particularly
the concentric color-band installations like Wall Drawing 579.

The piece is constructed using a procedural rule system:
1. Draw a large arch (rounded rectangle with a semicircular top).
2. Draw a slightly smaller arch inside it.
3. Repeat, each time reducing width and height.

This follows LeWitt’s conceptual art principle:
“The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.”

The code recreates the visual logic of the installation:
- The outer arch touches the top of the wall.
- Each inner arch is centered, narrower, and shorter.
- Colors are flat and uniform, mimicking painted wall surfaces.
